# SWIN Transformers

- An example of using the SWIN Transformer architecture as presented in the paper [Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14030.pdf) by Liu et. al.
- The architecture has been derived from `torchvision==0.13.0`
- Training and evaluation loops designed using tools from the PyTorch ecosystem
